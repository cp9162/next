# Next.fm

The client likes listening to new music, but has trouble managing playlists.

## Essential
Sometimes he’s in the mood for a genre of music. He would like to search for one track, play it, then automatically generate a list of similar tracks. The queue should be able to be edited, to remove lame songs. And he should be able to save a great playlist for later. The playlist should be about 10 songs long.

Pick initial song by searching for track title, genre, artist, or album name, but the search should only return songs. Might be helpful to have a song show view that displays album and artist information.

Similar to Last.fm - User can search a song and app will play related songs. But they have ads and it’s paid. Free and ad-free are important. And the user can’t save their playlist. 

Unique, fresh, responsive, HTML5. Cool transitions. Brown. Cleanliness in design. No design elements that aren’t absolutely necessary. Minimalist.

## Nice to have:
It would be cool to be able to share with other users.
Song should not stop playing even if user clicks around on site.
Nice to have: a toolbar that persists on each page.
